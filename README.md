charts with vue js
=======

Assalaamu'alaykum...

I just followed this tutorial -> https://medium.com/js-dojo/how-to-add-charts-and-graphs-to-a-vue-js-application-29f943a45d09
and just uploaded the source code to my github.

It is easy to create charts in your app using VueJS. Just follow the tutorial above and you'll be happy to see the result.

I hope you have a great day!
